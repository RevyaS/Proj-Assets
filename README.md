**Change notes:**

**Planned changes completed so far:**
- [x] GameData folder arrangement
- [ ] Separate Story files arrangement and ease of implementation
- [x] Separate EventData files per Route
- [ ] StoryData folder that stores data for that specific story only
- [x] New EventData and Route data file format
- [x] Sfx system for Events
- [ ] Sfx system for Locations
- [ ] Bgm system for Locations and Events
- [x] Changeable background during Event
- [x] Customizable starting stats and character flags
- [x] Event and Route key modifier % : (Adding a % modifier like this "%Text%" makes Event and Route keys unique though it presents the same text)
- [ ] New Storyline 
- [ ] Flexible use of assets on every story
- [ ] Save slots show the Story it belongs to
