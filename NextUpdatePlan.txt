//Puzzles
* Reskin Texture of puzzles based on context
- Maze
* Please Change Player.cs class name because it is too misleading
* Make it follow the mouse completely because it doesn't feel smooth to control
- Sliding Puzzle
* Only allow 1 click to move because there is only 1 open tile, so clicking any tile
next to the open tile will automatically move the tile towards the empty tile
* Add Difficulty settings
//General
* Cleanup the Options menu
* Resize files
* Polish visuals
* Extend storyline?
